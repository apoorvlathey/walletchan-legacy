WalletChan brings Ledger hardware wallet support, existing Safe multisigs,
Privacy Pools ETH shielding, and supported-token network fees into one redesigned
extension. Readable transaction review runs across the experience so you can
understand what will happen before approving.

It also supports private-key, seed-phrase, view-only, and Bankr API accounts,
along with swaps, bridges, batching, custom networks, and decentralized website
browsing.

## One wallet for every EVM chain

### Use the right account for the job

- Connect Ledger hardware accounts through Chromium WebHID and approve
  transactions and messages on the device.
- Discover or import existing Safe multisigs, review their configuration,
  propose transactions, collect approvals, and execute at quorum.
- Add private-key, seed-phrase, view-only, and Bankr API accounts.
- Assign accounts and networks to connected dapps without repeatedly changing one
  global wallet context.

### Understand what happens before approving

- Review plain-language transaction intent and signer identity.
- Preview simulated asset changes.
- Decode calldata and supported clear-signing descriptors.
- Inspect signature domains, messages, and technical details.
- Batch compatible approvals and actions into fewer confirmations.

### Shield ETH inside the wallet

Shield Ethereum ETH
into a Privacy Pools balance and unshield through supported private-relay,
recipient-paid, or public-recovery paths.

Privacy Pools uses ASP/compliance processing and has minimums and fees. It
currently supports Ethereum ETH Shield/Unshield, not private in-pool transfers.
Public recovery can link the original deposit and exit.

### Pay network fees with supported tokens

Eligible accounts and requests can pay network fees with supported ERC-20 tokens,
including USDC on supported chains. Availability depends on the account, chain,
token, request, and transaction. Ledger accounts use native gas.

### Move across the EVM ecosystem

- Swap and bridge supported assets without leaving the wallet.
- Use built-in EVM networks or add custom RPC endpoints.
- Browse ENS, IPFS, and other supported decentralized names in an ordinary
  browser, with optional local IPFS support.
- Use WalletConnect and injected dapp connections.
- Keep WalletChan open as a popup, side panel, compact view, or full window.

## Privacy and control

- Private keys and seed phrases are encrypted locally.
- Ledger keys remain on the hardware device.
- WalletChan does not add behavioral analytics or advertising trackers to the extension.
- User-invoked features still connect to blockchain RPCs and required service
  providers.
- The extension and its build system are open source.

<!-- Before publishing the v4 README, reconcile PRIVACY_POLICY.md with the
expanded v4 provider and data-flow inventory. -->
